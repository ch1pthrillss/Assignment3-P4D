        <h2 class="niconne">Overview of COVID-19</h2>
        <p>
            COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in late 2019 and quickly spread globally, leading to a pandemic. <br />
            It is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. <br />
            The virus can survive on surfaces, making it important to maintain good hygiene practices.
        </p>
        <h4 class="niconne">Global Impact</h4>
        <p>
            The impact of COVID-19 has been profound, affecting millions of lives worldwide. <br />
            It has strained healthcare systems, led to economic challenges, and caused significant disruptions in daily life. <br />
            Countries have faced waves of infections, overwhelming hospitals and healthcare workers. <br />
            Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, are at higher risk of severe illness and mortality.

        </p>
        <h4 class="niconne">
            Importance of Vaccination
        </h4>
        <p>

            Preventing Severe Illness: COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be highly effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death caused by the virus. Getting vaccinated significantly reduces the risk of severe outcomes.<br />
            Community Immunity (Herd Immunity): Vaccination helps in achieving community immunity, where a significant portion of the population becomes immune to the virus. This makes it harder for the virus to spread, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated, such as individuals with certain medical conditions.<br />
            Reducing Transmission: Vaccinated individuals are less likely to spread the virus to others. By reducing transmission, vaccines help in breaking the chain of infection, leading to a decline in overall cases.<br />
            Ending the Pandemic: Vaccination efforts contribute to slowing down the spread of the virus, facilitating the gradual return to normalcy. It plays a pivotal role in eventually ending the pandemic and allowing societies to resume regular activities.<br />

    <section class="s2">
        <h2 class="niconne">Types of COVID-19 Vaccines</h2>
        <h4 class="niconne">mRNA Vaccines:</h4>
        <p>
            How They Work: mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, contain a piece of genetic material called messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA provides instructions to cells in the body to produce a harmless spike protein similar to that found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
            Stimulating the Immune System: Once the spike protein is produced, the immune system recognizes it as foreign and mounts an immune response, including the production of antibodies and activation of T cells. These immune responses prepare the body to fight the actual virus if the person is later exposed.

        </p>
        <h4 class="niconne">Viral Vector Vaccines:</h4>
        <p>
            How They Work: Viral vector vaccines, like the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, use a different, harmless virus (not SARS-CoV-2) as a vector. The vector virus is modified to carry the genetic material that codes for a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, often the spike protein.
            Stimulating the Immune System: When the vaccine is administered, the modified virus enters cells and instructs them to produce the spike protein. The immune system recognizes the spike protein as a threat and mounts a defense, generating antibodies and activating immune cells to fight the virus.

        </p>
        <h4 class="niconne">Protein Subunit Vaccines:</h4>
        <p>
            How They Work: Protein subunit vaccines, like Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, contain harmless pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, often proteins or protein fragments (such as the spike protein). These pieces cannot cause disease on their own.
            Stimulating the Immune System: When the vaccine is injected, the immune system recognizes these viral pieces as foreign invaders. Antibodies and immune cells are produced to attack these pieces. If the person is later exposed to the actual virus, the immune system recognizes it and can mount a swift defense, preventing illness.

        </p>
        <h4 class="niconne">Inactivated or Live Attenuated Vaccines:</h4>
        <p>
            How They Work: Inactivated vaccines use virus particles that have been killed, while live attenuated vaccines use weakened, non-disease-causing forms of the virus. Both types cannot cause the disease they are designed to protect against.
            Stimulating the Immune System: The immune system recognizes these weakened or inactivated viruses as foreign and mounts a defense. Antibodies and immune cells are produced to attack the harmless virus. If the person is later exposed to the live virus, the immune system recognizes it and fights it effectively.

    <div id="toggle-button-s3" class="toggle-button">+ Reduced Risk of Severe Illness, Hospitalization, and Death</div>
    <section class="s3">
        <h2 class="niconne">Reduced Risk of Severe Illness, Hospitalization, and Death</h2>
        <p>
            Reduced Severity of Symptoms:<br />
            COVID-19 vaccines significantly lower the risk of developing severe symptoms if infected. Vaccinated individuals are less likely to experience severe respiratory distress, organ damage, or long-term complications associated with the virus.<br />
            Lower Hospitalization Rates:<br />
            Vaccinated individuals are far less likely to require hospitalization due to COVID-19. By reducing the severity of the illness, vaccines alleviate the strain on healthcare systems, ensuring that hospital beds and medical resources are available for other critical healthcare needs.<br />
            Decreased Mortality Rates:<br />
            COVID-19 vaccines substantially decrease the risk of mortality. Vaccinated individuals are highly protected against COVID-19-related deaths. The vaccines have proven to be life-saving, preventing numerous fatalities worldwide.
        </p>
        <h4 class="niconne"> Protection for the Individual and the Community</h4>
        <p>
            Individual Protection:<br />
            Immune Response: Vaccination triggers the body's immune response, creating antibodies and memory cells specific to the virus. This immune memory provides rapid defense if the person is exposed to the actual virus, ensuring a quicker and more effective response.
            Boosted Immunity: For those who have previously contracted COVID-19, vaccination acts as a booster, enhancing the immune response. It provides stronger and longer-lasting immunity against reinfection, including with new variants of the virus.<br />
            Community Immunity (Herd Immunity):<br />
            Slowing Virus Spread: By reducing transmission rates, vaccinated individuals contribute to slowing down the overall spread of the virus within communities. This is crucial in controlling outbreaks and preventing new waves of infections.
            Protecting Vulnerable Populations: Vaccination protects those who cannot be vaccinated, such as individuals with certain medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Achieving high vaccination rates creates a protective barrier around vulnerable communities, preventing the virus from reaching them.<br />
            Returning to Normalcy:<br />
            Widespread vaccination is a key factor in returning to a sense of normalcy. It allows for the gradual lifting of restrictions, resumption of social activities, and reopening of businesses, schools, and public spaces. Vaccination is essential for rebuilding economies and communities that have been impacted by the pandemic.
